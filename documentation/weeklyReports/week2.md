## week 2 4h + 3h

### What have I done this week?
- Made sudoku core functionality work
- Some tests for sudoku
- Backtracking algorithm works
- Tests for algorithm
- Generic arraylist implementation
- Add github actions to build, run tests and upload code coverage to codecov
- JavaFX ui where player can play sudoku from start to finish

### How has the program progressed
Very well. Got the game and algorithm work fairly quickly. 

### What I learned?
Following recursive code is hard. JavaFX is horrifying.

### Problems?
Don't know if my project is large enough for good grade.

### Next week
